                            <h2>About Me</h2>                       
                            <p>I am a 22 year old freshman at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. I was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I graduated from McCaskey High School in 2018. I currently still live in Lancaster with my two cats and ball python. I am fascinated by software design and enjoy programming. I am currently working with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tccp.org/wit/"> TCCP</a>, WIT Women In Tech mentorship program. My mentor is Susan Lehr, the operations manager at DevTech. Which is a company that partners with BlueCross BlueSheild to fulfill their programming needs. This program provides young women in the tech industry to learn from one another and grow together. This opprotunity has allowed me to network myself and my work. If you'd like to see my projects and what I am currently working on please check out my <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="project.html">projects</a> page.</p>
